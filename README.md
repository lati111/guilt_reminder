# Guilt reminder

Guilt reminder is a simple reminder app designed for those who struggle with procrastination. When one of the entered tasks is past the set due date it will continually send you notifications. May it help you stay productive!

## Features
- Reminders every 5 minutes when past 3
- A 3 stage task completion dialog so swiftly dismissing it is harder to do
- Guilt trippy and encouraging messages for tasks

## Requirements
- Android version 14 or above

## Updates
This project will receive little to no development in the future as it was made for a specific person's usage, so unless they want any changes the app will remain as is. 
If someone makes a pull request however I will still look and approve / disapprove it.
